## Self Introduction

I am an engineer passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology and product innovation, specializing in front-end and full-stack development, AI engineering, and human-computer interaction. I integrate system, product, and interaction design to build intelligent products with exceptional user experience. I am passionate about large-scale interactive systems and focus on continuous optimization and innovation. I excel in rapid learning, systematic engineering thinking, and problem-solving, ensuring technology creates real impact and drives meaningful change.

## Something I want to talk

I have been exploring my career path and the meaning of life. I‚Äôm searching for something that brings me fulfillment and joy, allows me to **truly** help others, matches my abilities, and enables me to continuously grow. For a long time, I felt lost, and uncertain about what I wanted to do or what I was capable of. But now, things are becoming clearer.

I enjoy programming, development, and interaction. I love learning about software development, writing code bit by bit, and seeing my work make even the slightest difference for others. I take pleasure in continuously optimizing, learning, solving problems, and collaborating with others throughout the process. I focus more on the details of coding and bring both myself and others an enjoyable development, creativity, and wonderful user experience.

The knowledge taught in school is quite limited, and no matter how good the university is, as a developer, I can only truly strengthen my abilities through self-learning and hands-on projects.
